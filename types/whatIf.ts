 * What If Analysis — life-event scenarios applied to the user's FIRE plan.
 *
 * Design: each v1 event is applied "from now" (year 0) and reduces to a perturbation of
 * three baseline inputs — net worth, annual savings, annual expenses. The impact is then
 * computed by re-running the existing deterministic FIRE/Coast functions on the adjusted
 * inputs and diffing against the baseline, so no new projection math is introduced. This
 * is the same pattern the FIRE sensitivity matrix already uses.
 *
 * Future timing of events ("in N years") is intentionally out of scope for v1; it would
 * require timed cash events inside calculateFIREProjection.
