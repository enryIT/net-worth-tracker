# CLAUDE.md - Net Worth Tracker (Lean)

## Project Overview
Net Worth Tracker is a Next.js app for Italian investors to track net worth, assets, cashflow, dividends, performance metrics, and long-term planning with Firebase.

## Current Status
- Stack: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind v4, Firebase, Vitest, Framer Motion, Recharts, Yahoo Finance, Borsa Italiana scraping, Anthropic
- Latest implementation (2026-05-04): **investment operation ledger + realized sales + internal transfers**. Added `types/investments.ts`, `lib/services/investmentOperationService.ts`, pure calculation helpers in `lib/utils/investmentOperationUtils.ts`, and tests in `__tests__/investmentOperationService.test.ts`. Cashflow entries can now register buy/sell investment operations with quantity, estimated unit price, fees, taxes, weighted-average-cost updates, and realized gain/tax data. Dividend stats expose `realizedInvestmentSummary`, and Cashflow has a `Trasferimenti` tab for cash-to-cash transfers that update balances without affecting income/expense savings metrics. Firestore rules cover `investmentOperations` and `internalTransfers`; no composite index is required because current client/admin queries filter only by `userId` and sort in memory. Verification: `tsc --noEmit` pass; full Vitest: 488 pass, 1 pre-existing fail in `assistantPromptRouting`.
- Latest implementation (2026-04-30, session drifting-sutherland): **YOC TTM filter fix + dependency security updates**. `app/api/dividends/stats/route.ts`: TTM dividend filter changed from `exDate >= twelveMonthsAgo` to `paymentDate >= twelveMonthsAgo && paymentDate <= today` — YOC card now correctly hidden when no dividends have been received, since `allDividends` includes future entries and `exDate` does not cap at today. `npm audit fix` + `next@16.2.4`: resolved `protobufjs` critical (arbitrary code execution) and `next` high (DoS via server components). 14 remaining vulnerabilities are untreatable without breaking changes (all in `firebase-admin` transitive chain: `@tootallnate/once`, `uuid`, `google-gax`; and `postcss` inside next's bundle — reported fix is `next@9.3.3`, a false positive). Tests: 483 pass, 1 pre-existing fail in `assistantPromptRouting`.
- Previous (2026-04-29, session unified-whale): **Email category breakdown + AI comment rendering fixes**. `monthlyEmailService.ts`: `aggregateExpenses()` now tracks income categories (`allIncomeCategories`) and returns all expense categories without cap. `MonthlyEmailData` gains `allIncomeCategories`. Email HTML: new "Entrate per Categoria" table (all income categories, EUR + %) after cashflow summary; "Spese per Categoria" (renamed from "Top Categorie di Spesa") shows all categories with % column. `simpleMarkdownToHtml()` rewrite: collapsed `</li>\n\n<li>` before `<ul>` wrapping; `\n\n` → `<br/><br/>` with post-processing to strip `<br/>` around heading `<p>` and reduce to single `<br/>` around `<ul>/<ol>`; added `<ol>` support via placeholder pattern; added `*italic*` → `<em>`; strip `<details>/<summary>`; increased heading `margin-top` from `8px` to `16px`. Tests: 81 pass.
- Previous (2026-04-28, session jazzy-fountain): **Contesto macro in chat libera**. `resolveAssistantWebSearchPolicy` in `webSearchPolicy.ts`: in chat mode, `return preferences.includeMacroContext || shouldUseWebSearch(prompt)` — toggle ON = web search sempre attivo, toggle OFF = fallback a keyword detection. Tests: 93 pass.
- Previous (2026-04-26, session ai-email-comment): **AI comment in periodic emails**. All three email types (monthly/quarterly/yearly) now include a "Commento AI" section. New `quarter_analysis` mode added to `AssistantMode`. `generateEmailAiComment()` wraps everything in try/catch — AI failure never blocks email. `selector.quarter` field so quarterly renders "Q1 2026" not "Marzo 2026". Tests: 93 pass.

## Architecture Snapshot
- App Router with protected pages under `app/dashboard/*`
- Service layer in `lib/services/*`
- Shared utilities in `lib/utils/*`
- React Query for caching and invalidation
- Italy timezone helpers in `lib/utils/dateHelpers.ts`

## Key Features (Active)
- **Demo mode (2026-04-16)**: `app/page.tsx` is now a landing page with "Prova la Demo" auto-login and feature overview. Same CTA on `/login`. `useDemoMode()` hook (`lib/hooks/useDemoMode.ts`) — compares `user.uid` against `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_USER_ID`; returns `false` if either is absent. All mutation buttons across every page use `disabled={isDemo}` + `title` tooltip. Demo banner in dashboard layout (`FlaskConical` amber strip). `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_AI_ENABLED=false` should be set for the demo Firebase project. Credentials (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_EMAIL/PASSWORD`) are baked into the bundle — acceptable for a non-sensitive public demo; leave vars empty to hide the CTA on self-hosted deploys.
- Portfolio tracking across equities, bonds, pension funds, crypto, real estate, commodities, and cash
- Pension funds are a dedicated `AssetType` (`pensionfund`): manual valuation from the provider, default illiquid, no automatic price update, stamp-duty exempt, included in historical tables, and best represented as a composite asset for allocation/simulation accuracy. Pension-fund metadata is intentionally lean (`provider`, `fundLine`, `membershipDate`, `expectedRetirementDate`) because tax deductions and contribution flows belong in cashflow/planning, not on the net-worth asset record.
- Automatic price updates via Yahoo Finance and Borsa Italiana bond support
- **Multi-theme color system (2026-04-10)**: 6 selectable themes — `default`, `solar-dusk`, `elegant-luxury`, `midnight-bloom`, `cyberpunk`, `retro-arcade`. Persisted in Firestore `userPreferences/{userId}` + localStorage. `ColorThemeContext` manages `data-theme` on `<html>`, independent of next-themes dark/light. View Transition circle-reveal on dark/light toggle (CSS vars `--vt-cx/cy/r` + `document.startViewTransition`). Chart colors theme-aware via `useChartColors` (reads `--chart-1..5` after paint via `requestAnimationFrame`; oklch luminance filter: L>0.82 light fallback, L<0.30 dark fallback). Bottom navigation uses `--sidebar-*` CSS vars for theme sync. Theme selector in Settings → Aspetto (grid `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 desktop:grid-cols-6`). Dark theme chroma must be ≥0.020 to be perceptible on dark backgrounds. Key files: `lib/services/userPreferencesService.ts`, `contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx`, `lib/hooks/useChartColors.ts`, `app/globals.css` (theme blocks), `components/layout/BottomNavigation.tsx`.
- Assistente AI (2026-04-10): 5 modes — `month_analysis`, `year_analysis`, `ytd_analysis`, `history_analysis`, `chat`. Chat mode has `chatContextType` selector (`none | month | year | ytd | history`), default `'none'`. `bySubCategoryAllocation` in context bundle. `selector.month` encoding: `>0`=monthly, `0`=year, `-1`=YTD, `-2`=history. `useAssistantPeriodContext` unifies all 4 context hooks. `includeMacroContext` gates web search in analysis modes; chat mode uses keyword-based policy in `webSearchPolicy.ts` (keyword list + explicit phrases). Extended thinking (budget 2000) + 3500 max_tokens. `resolvedThreadId` pattern avoids stale RQ cache. Feature flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_AI_ENABLED`. Persistent conversations, auto-memory, markdown with tables. Memory extraction runs in all modes, gated by `memoryEnabled` only. Memory panel now supports active/completed/archived goal lifecycle plus pending suggestions with explicit confirm/ignore actions. Structured goal parsing supports natural-language numeric goals for cash, liquid net worth, net worth, asset classes, sub-categories, and allocation percentages. `Liquidità` goals evaluate against cash only; `patrimonio liquido` uses `liquidNetWorth`. `includeDummySnapshots` preference: toggle visible only when `hasDummySnapshots`. **Stop**: `AbortController` in `abortControllerRef`. **Delete confirmations**: 2-click inline with 3s auto-disarm. **Mobile**: composer chip strip for mode + chat context (`desktop:hidden`); `pb-[env(safe-area-inset-bottom,0px)]` for iPhone home bar; Brain icon Sheet for memory panel; `AssistantContextPill` in conversation header; `flex-col` two-row header buttons on mobile. `CollapsibleTrigger` always `asChild` in `AssistantMemoryPanel`. **Conversation history**: cap chat 10 pairs, structured 3 pairs. **A11y**: `aria-live` on stream container; `role="tablist/tab"` on memory filters; action buttons always visible on touch; `scrollIntoView instant` during streaming. **Animations**: Framer Motion on all 5 assistant components — staggered chip mount, message fade/slide, memory item cascade + height-collapse exit, context card `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` keyed on period, streaming badge fade. `useReducedMotion()` everywhere. **Guide**: collapsible "Come funziona" in page header (below subtitle, above buttons) — content outside flex-row so it spans full width on desktop. Textarea scrollbar hidden via `[&::-webkit-scrollbar]:hidden [scrollbar-width:none]`.
- Login and Register now feel more native to the product, with calmer entry motion, cleaner field focus choreography, keyboard-reachable password toggles, and inline submit status feedback
- Hall of Fame now reads as an editorial ranking surface with clearer monthly/yearly hierarchy, spotlight cards for the current month/year, and contextual note dialogs tied to the selected record
- Cashflow "Entrate per categoria" pie chart on mobile now caps legend items at 3 (same as expense chart), preventing overflow when 4+ categories exceed the 5% threshold
- Overview "Distribuzione per Asset" pie chart on mobile now caps legend items at 5 (`>= 7%` filter then `.slice(0, 5)`), preventing the fixed 350px container from clipping the pie when a portfolio has many assets
- Cashflow now preserves context better across `Tracciamento`, `Dividendi & Cedole`, `Anno Corrente`, `Storico Totale`, and `Budget`, with calmer filter feedback and a steadier Budget deep-dive flow
- Cashflow Sankey back-navigation now restores the immediate parent drill-down level first, so moving back from a subcategory returns to the category view before the full flow
- Dividendi & Cedole now keeps calendar day focus, active date filtering, table/detail context, and summary cards more tightly in sync, with a read-only contextual detail step before edit mode
- Storico "Evoluzione Patrimonio Netto" line chart now renders as a clean continuous line — per-point dots removed; amber note-indicator markers are preserved for snapshots with notes (`CustomChartDot`, `activeDot` hover still active)
- Storico now reads more like a guided analysis surface: main sections enter as chapters, dense blocks are separated more clearly, chart mode switches feel local instead of page-wide, and doubling milestones build progressively
- Rendimenti now presents smoother period switching, KPI settling from prior values, staged monthly heatmap reveal, a more legible underwater drawdown surface, and contextual custom-range / AI dialogs
- Allocazione now presents a more readable drill-down path on desktop and a steadier mobile sheet experience, with each drill-down level reopening from the top and progress bars using centered target markers
- Patrimonio now preserves visited macro-tab and sub-tab state across `Gestione Asset`, `Anno Corrente`, and `Storico`, with calmer transitions for dense historical tables, scoped refresh feedback on the active view, and a hidden previous-month baseline for `Anno Corrente` so first-month comparisons and summary percentages remain accurate without adding an extra visible column
- Patrimonio Anno Corrente and Storico tables show only assets with `includeInHistoryTables: true` (toggle in AssetDialog). Anno Corrente: `quantity > 0` only. Storico: includes `quantity === 0` for sold-asset history with "Venduto" badge. `restrictToPassedAssets={true}` on both tables. Disabling cost basis in AssetDialog correctly deletes `averageCost`/`taxRate` from Firestore via `deleteField()`
- Overview/Panoramica now loads KPI, variations, expense summary, charts, and rendering flags from one authenticated overview query, improving warm loads and keeping related data in sync after asset, cashflow, snapshot, and stamp-duty-setting changes
- Overview/Dashboard KPI cards all animate on mount via `OverviewAnimatedCurrency` leaf nodes (count-up isolated per card, not page-level). Charts mount after hero settles via `requestIdleCallback`. Formatter cache in `lib/utils/formatters.ts` avoids `Intl.NumberFormat` allocation on every render.
- Overview/Panoramica greeting is now consistent with the shared header format, showing the first name without a comma
- Private API actions now require verified Firebase auth server-side, while scheduled maintenance flows continue to authenticate with `CRON_SECRET`
- **Cost Centers (2026-04-14)**: optional 6th tab in Cashflow (`costCentersEnabled` toggle in Settings → Preferenze). Group expenses by object/project (e.g. "Automobile Dacia"). Per-center KPI cards, monthly spend chart, linked transaction table. Assignment via `ExpenseDialog` selector. Delete/rename cascade to linked expenses via `writeBatch`. Firestore collection: `costCenters`. New composite indexes: `costCenters/{userId+createdAt}`, `expenses/{userId+costCenterId+date}`.
- Cashflow tracking with categories, filters, Sankey drill-down, budget management, and linked cash-account updates
- History page with net worth evolution, asset class breakdown, liquidity, YoY variation, savings vs investment growth, `Lavoro & Investimenti`, doubling analysis, and allocation comparison
- `Lavoro & Investimenti` in History now includes:
  - lifetime KPI cards for labor income, saved from work (with total expenses sub-line), gross investment growth, and net investment growth
  - positive-month and negative-month counters based on monthly `netWorthGrowth`
  - monthly chart from `prepareMonthlyLaborMetricsData()`
- Settings page now offers visible unsaved-state preview and clearer in-context feedback for sensitive configuration changes (without autosave behavior changes)
- Dividends and coupons tracking with EUR conversion, focused monthly calendar, contextual per-payment detail view, total return per asset, and DPS growth summaries
- FIRE planning now includes local preview feedback, rolling 12-month runway history, separate total/liquid runway deltas vs the same month a year earlier, a Base-scenario sensitivity matrix for annual spending vs annual savings, steadier scenario projections, clearer liquid vs illiquid readouts, and a dedicated `Coast FIRE` tab. Coast FIRE reuses `userAge`, persists `coastFireRetirementAge`, uses real annual expenses from the last completed year (or user-defined custom expenses via `coastFireCustomExpenses`), models Bear/Base/Bull outcomes with `real return = growth - inflation`, and optionally reduces retirement portfolio needs with one or more state pensions entered as gross future nominal monthly amounts, exact pension dates, and editable IRPEF brackets. The state-pension area now combines a compact summary-first explanation, a collapsible configuration panel with visible key inputs, and separate informational vs incomplete-state messaging for pension timing. The pension UI is fully responsive: 2-col input grid on mobile (pairing Nome+Lordo / Mensilità+Decorrenza) with `items-start` (hint text below inputs prevents `items-end` baseline trick), compact breakdown table, inline tax bracket rows with `items-end` (no hint text), and 40px touch targets on all destructive buttons. Pension card header always `flex-row` so trash icon stays top-right. Config section for Scaglioni IRPEF stacks on mobile (text above, full-width button below). `buildPensionDraftIssues` is a pure function receiving `now: Date` as explicit param.
- Monte Carlo simulations now preserve result continuity across reruns, with progressive percentile/distribution reveal and more explicit Bear/Base/Bull comparison focus
- Goal-based investing now links summary cards, allocation chart, and detail cards through a shared focus model for faster visual comprehension
- PDF export and AI-powered performance analysis

## Testing
- Framework: Vitest
- Useful commands:
  - `npm test -- <file>`
  - `npx vitest run <file>`
  - `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Current repo includes targeted tests for pure utilities/services plus private API auth regression coverage in `__tests__/apiAuthRoutes.test.ts`, overview/materialized-summary coverage in `__tests__/dashboardOverviewService.test.ts`, performance utilities in `__tests__/performanceService.test.ts`, assistant auth / policy coverage in `__tests__/assistantRoutes.test.ts`, `__tests__/assistantWebSearchPolicy.test.ts`, `__tests__/assistantPromptRouting.test.ts`, `__tests__/assistantMonthContextService.test.ts`, `__tests__/assistantThreadRoutes.test.ts`, `__tests__/assistantMemoryExtraction.test.ts`, SRP characterization tests in `__tests__/assetDialogHelpers.test.ts` and `__tests__/snapshotHelpers.test.ts`, and layer-separation tests in `__tests__/dividendUseCase.test.ts` and `__tests__/dividendProcessor.test.ts`

## Data & Integrations
- Firestore client + admin
- Yahoo Finance for prices
- Borsa Italiana scraping for Italian bonds and dividend data
- Frankfurter API for FX conversion
- Anthropic for AI analysis

## Known Issues (Active)
- FX conversion depends on Frankfurter API availability; cache fallback (24h TTL) is used on failure — pre-migration non-EUR assets (USD, CHF, etc.) without `currentPriceEur` will show native price as EUR until first price update. GBp assets are safe: the pence→GBP fallback (`currentPrice / 100`) prevents the 100× inflation even without `currentPriceEur`.
- Demo account requires manual Firebase setup (create user, populate Firestore with realistic fake data, set three env vars)
